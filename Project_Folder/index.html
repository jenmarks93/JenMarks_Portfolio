 	<p>As the Web Development Intern at Greater Cincinnati World Affairs Council (GCWAC), I worked on many different projects.  I did trouble-shooting and coding through the back-end of the Wordpress-based website, while also creating all the graphics (buttons, images, etc.) that were used on the website.  During my time at GCWAC, I also developed educational games, helped plan events, and had my work printed as business cards and bookmarks.  My day-to-day duties included (but were not limited to): updating global calendar with new events, creating numerous designs for graphics, researching certain topics for further exploration, and fixing/editing the website through the back-end code.
